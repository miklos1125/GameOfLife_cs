# GameOfLife
A program for John Horton Conway's mathematical game. // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

In every round:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
See programming details after the picture.

This program is written in C#. Years before I've made another version in Java:   https://github.com/miklos1125/GameOfLife
Since this repository has been created by Visual Studio, it contains tons of auto-generated code. 
You can find the essential source files with the extension ".cs", I detail their contents below along with the coding challenges.

Program.cs
- The entry point of the program. As usual start of a "System.Windows.Forms" Form.

Form1.Designer.cs
- As the former one this file is auto-generated by the Form Designer tool of the Visual Studio.
  It contains almost all of the code that describes the visual elements, and the names of their underlying methods.


//The text from here is currently being prepared:


Form1.cs
- initializing, graphics and animation

Form1.MyDesign.cs
- solution of the flickering problem with Panel and animation

Cell.cs
- A class for classical objects

Form1.Associated.cs
- c# partial class...
- algorithm for finding neighbours, calculating next generation of cells,
- partialy recursive algorithm for finding and counting separate cell islands
- algorithm managing history to find repeatings

Form1.Buttons.cs
- logic of buttons

Form1.Mouse.cs
- for editing cell structure
